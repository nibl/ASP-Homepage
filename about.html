<p>Have you ever got stuck trying to do something on your iPhone or iPad that's normally a breeze on your desktop or laptop? Did you have to tell someone "Sorry, I'm on my phone right now. I'll do that when I'm back at my desk."?<br />
That's kind of frustrating when you already have a powerful computer in your hand.</p>

<h2>Ready to get down to business on iOS?</h2>
<br/>
<p>You can do a lot more on your iPad and iPhone than you might think. Sure, you will still need a laptop or desktop for certain things, but with the right apps and workflows, you can do a lot of your work on your iPhone or iPad.</p>

<h2>I'm Marcus and I've been using pocket-sized computers since 1983â€¦Yes, really.</h2>

<p>You can read more about that here. When a serious back problem meant I couldn't sit at my desk, I was forced to find a way of getting serious work done on handheld devices. I know what it's like when you get stuck trying to get work done, and I'm eager to find solutions that you can use too.</p>


<h2>What are you struggling with most of all on your iPhone or iPad?</h2>
<br/>

<p>Tell me. I will reply to you personally, and try to find a solution. Then I will post it so others may also benefit.</p>
