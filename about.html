Have you ever got stuck trying to do something on your iPhone or iPad that's normally a breeze on your desktop or laptop? Did you have to tell someone "Sorry, I'm on my phone right now. I'll do that when I'm back at my desk."?
That's kind of frustrating when you already have a powerful computer in your hand, isn't it.

## Ready to go to work on iOS?

You can do a lot more on your iPad and iPhone than you might think. Sure, you will still need a laptop or desktop for certain things, but with the right apps and workflows, you can do a lot of your work on your iPhone or iPad.

I've been using pocket-sized computers since 1983â€¦Yes, really. You can read more about that here. In 2014, a serious back problem meant I couldn't sit at my desk. I was forced to find a way of getting serious work done on handheld devices. I know what it's like when you get stuck trying to get work done, and I'm eager to find solutions.

##  What are you struggling with most of all on your iPhone or iPad?

**Tell me**. I will reply to you personally, and try to find a solution. Then I will post it so others may also benefit.
