Can you really get work done on your iPhone or iPad? Or will you have to say things like "Sorry, I'm on my iPhone right now. I'll get back to you when I'm at my desk"?

Can you really get work done on your iPhone or iPad? Or will you have to say things like "Sorry, I'm on my iPhone right now. I'll get back to you when I'm at my desk"?

Movitos is here to answer **yes** to all those questions and more, whenever possible. The preference will always be the simplest method with the best experience.

## Apps Make the Difference
There's an immense creative potential within the apps available for iOS today. The simplicity of touchscreen apps makes it far easier to work with images and sound than on a desktop computer. You don't need to spend days learning how to use the software before you can start creating.

Movitos will explore the best apps and workflows for a given task. Interviews with people producing and creating on iOS will provide real world examples of how people use mobile devices to get  serious work done.

## Explore the Possibilities
Today, you can work for your customers and clients remotely. You can run your business from home, and do your accounting on the road.

Whether for business or hobby, you can record and edit videos, music, and podcasts entirely on your mobile devices. You can publish a blog from your phone, complete with photos and videos, while travelling the world.

It's an exciting, liberating time. One that democratises how we work, create and distribute. Grab your iOS device and let's explore the possibilities.
