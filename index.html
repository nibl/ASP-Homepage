<p>As developers we want to build things. Presented with a problem, our minds immediately going into problem-solving mode and we figure out how to implement a solution. We rush in and build something, only to discover people are not interested.
<br /> Our problem is we are so excited to build new features that we often forget our users' true needs. The problem with that is, that we can end up spending time and resources developing features people don't really want or need, and of course won't pay for either.

<br />Feature Scrutinizer is an interactive application which asks the tough questions about each feature we want to implement. It asks about user needs, possible changes to an existing user experience, required development resources, finances, the increase in value, and how it may impact your business. The amount of questions feature scrutinizer may ask depends on your answers. It will take the shortest route to providing quality guidance. <br />After scrutinizing a proposed feature, you will know whether to implement, scrap, or postpone development of that feature.<br />

Here's what Feature Scrutinizer can do for you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pick features worth your time and resources</li>
	<li>Avoid feature creep</li>
	<li>Focus on moving your users forward</li>
</ul>

  -- Steve Jobs at WWDC, 1997.</blockquote>
  
<p class="topmargin50">It's important to learn and internalize this process. At every step to be considering how the feature will benefit users, and your business. Repeating this process creates an awareness of your software as part of a business. A software business that moves people forward.</p>
